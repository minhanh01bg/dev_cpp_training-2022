/**
  * Here's my approach for DIV1E. The main idea is to see which segments must be 
  * colored differently, which we approach in a greedy way.
  * First, sort the segments (first by increasing start coordinate, breaking ties 
  * by end coordinate). Now, take the first two segments, and call them A and B. 
  * Observe the following cases. I'll be using A.s to refer to the start coordinate, 
  * and A.e to refer to the end coordinate.
  *     + A.e < B.s: Segment A doesn't interact with any other segment, so we can 
  *       color it arbitrarily, so we remove A from the list of segments.
  *     + otherwise, A.e >= B.s: We want to color A and B different colors to cancel 
  *       them out, however, all we know is that they must be different, so we 
  *       remember this by adding an edge in between them. Notice that the interval 
  *       from A.s to B.s-1 will have an excess of one red or blue, but since the 
  *       segments are sorted, no other segments will touch that, so we don't have 
  *       to worry about them. Thus, the only tricky part is the left over stuff at 
  *       the right end. We deal with these in the following three subcases:
  *             + A.e == B.e: There is no left over, so remove both A and B from the 
  *               list and continue.
  *             + A.e < B.e: Everything up to A.e is good. However, we set the new 
  *               start point of B to be A.e+1, and remove A from the list of segments.
  *             + B.e < A.e: This is symmetric to the case above.
  * We repeat the following procedure until we have less than two segments. Now we 
  * have a graph, with nodes representing segments, and an edge between them if the 
  * nodes need to be colored differently. We can see we have a solution if and only 
  * if this graph is two-colorable. However, notice that the above procedure does 
  * not produce any cycles in the graph, so the graph we have is a tree, which we can 
  * always two-color, so we just go through this tree and assign colors.
